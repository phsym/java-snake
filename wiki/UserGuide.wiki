= Introduction =

This wiki page is a user guide. The game is quite simple, but here's a reminder about how it works.


= Details =

==Controls==
Here are the controls. You can't change them, sorry :

  * *UP*, *DOWN*, *LEFT*, *RIGHT* arrows : Control your snake
  * *SPACE* : Pause the game
  * *ESCAPE* : Exit the game
  * *F11* : Switch to/from a bigger frame

==Bonus==

  * *Grey bonus* : A simple bonus that grows your snake with 1 (there's always one in the board).
  * *Green bonus* : Appears each 10 points you earn. They stay during 100 moves (approx 5 seconds) and grows your snake with 3

==Other==

  * When you reach a game limit (window border), your snake will continue at the opposite side.
  * If your snake eats a part of himself, the the game is over.
